# Enhancing the snake game

Now it is time to add even more features to our snake game. This is the part of the workshop where GitHub Copilot really becomes the assistant that makes you excel and improve your skills. 

## Don't be a copy paste champion

As you go through the exercises below, **remember to read the output from Copilot and do your best to understand that output**. It can be tempting to just copy and paste like a Stack Overflow champion, but this is a real opportunity to learn how to build an application in a new way. 

## More features to implement

The aim for this session is to add 1 or 2 new features to your version of the game. Really make it your own. 

Below is a list of potential features you can implement in your snake game to enhance its gameplay and user experience:

1. **Multiple Game Modes** – Classic, timed survival, puzzle mode, or “reverse snake.”
2. **Power-Ups & Debuffs** – Speed boosts, slow-time fields, invincibility, or reverse-controls traps.
3. **Obstacles & Hazards** – Static walls, moving blocks, spikes, or disappearing tiles.
4. **Wrapping vs Bounded Edges** – Let the snake loop around or die at the borders.
5. **Themed Skins & Palettes** – Unlockable snake/food textures (neon, retro, nature).
6. **Dynamic Difficulty** – Automatically ramp up speed or obstacle density based on score.
7. **Level Progression** – Distinct levels with unique layouts, objectives, and boss snakes.
8. **Combo Scoring** – Chains of food eaten quickly multiply your points.
9. **Daily/Weekly Challenges** – Special grids or target lengths to earn badges.
10. **Global Leaderboards** – Track high scores, fastest times, or longest snakes.
11. **Achievement System** – In-game trophies for milestones (e.g. 100 food eaten, no-death run).
12. **Ghost Replay** – Watch a translucent “ghost” of your best run alongside current play.
13. **Local Co-op Mode** – Two players on the same keyboard or split-screen.
14. **Competitive Multiplayer** – Head-to-head on one grid, trying to outlast or eliminate each other.
15. **AI Opponents** – Computer-controlled snakes with tweakable difficulty/behaviors.
16. **Customizable Controls** – Remap keys or support gamepad, touch, and tilt inputs.
17. **Map Editor** – Build and share your own obstacle layouts and challenge levels.
18. **Snake Customization** – Change head/tail shapes, add hats, trails, or particle effects.
19. **Boss Battles** – Face off against giant or multi-headed boss snakes with patterns to learn.
20. **Random Events** – Teleport pads, shrinking playfield, or sudden obstacle bursts.
21. **Day/Night & Weather** – Lighting changes, rain, fog, or falling leaves affecting visibility.
22. **Soundtrack & SFX** – Dynamic music that ramps up with speed and sound cues for events.
23. **Tutorial & Guided Mode** – Step-by-step intro missions to teach mechanics.
24. **Pause & Resume Anywhere** – Preserve game state for quick breaks.
25. **Replay Sharing** – Export or link to your best runs for social media.
26. **Accessibility Options** – Color-blind palettes, adjustable speeds, or one-button mode.
27. **In-Game Shop** – Earn coins to buy new skins, trails, or power-ups.
28. **Story Mode** – A light narrative that unlocks new levels or mechanics as you progress.
29. **Easter Eggs & Secrets** – Hidden modes or “snake within a snake” challenges.
30. **Performance Stats** – Post-game summary of top speed, length, precision turns, etc.

These features can make the snake game more engaging, customizable, and appealing to a wide range of players. The choice of which features to implement can depend on the target audience and the game's objectives.

## Giving Copilot instructions

When you implement any of these features with Copilot's help, consider these points

1. **Define Feature Requirements:**
   - Clearly define the requirements and objectives of the feature you want to implement.
   - Specify how the feature will enhance the gameplay experience for players.
2. **Research Existing Solutions:**
   - Explore existing implementations of similar features in other snake games or related projects.
   - Analyse their functionality, user interface, and implementation details.
3. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Break down the feature into smaller, manageable components or tasks.
   - Identify the core functionalities and interactions required to implement the feature.
4. **Write Natural Language Comments:**
   - Write clear and descriptive natural language comments that outline the feature's functionality and requirements.
   - Provide context and examples to guide Copilot in generating relevant code snippets.
5. **Trigger Copilot Suggestions:**
   - Start writing code around your comments to trigger GitHub Copilot suggestions.
   - Experiment with different comments and prompts to guide Copilot effectively.
6. **Review and Customize Suggestions:**
   - Review the code suggestions provided by Copilot and evaluate their relevance to your feature requirements.
   - Customize and refine the generated code to align with your specific needs and design preferences.
7. **Iterate and Refine:**
   - Iterate on the implementation based on user feedback and testing results.
   - Refine the feature to improve performance, usability, and overall user experience.
